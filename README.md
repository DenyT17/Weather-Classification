## Description ❔❓

In this project I use images depicting weather phenomena to image classification. I use TensorFlow and EfficientNet B0 pretrained model. 

For the time being I predict a weather phenomenon for four pictures:


## Dataset📁
Images used in this project you can find [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/4drtyfjtfy/1)

This datasets contain images depicting four weather phenomena such as:
* Rain
* Clody
* Sunrise
* Sunshine

I separated the photos into appropriate directories which I named accordingly. In futur i want extend the dataset with other weather phenomena.
